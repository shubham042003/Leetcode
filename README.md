This repository contains my solutions to various **LeetCode problems**, implemented as part of my daily coding practice. ðŸš€  

I solve problems across different difficulty levels (**Easy, Medium, Hard**) and multiple topics, including:  

- Arrays & Strings  
- Linked Lists  
- Stacks & Queues  
- Trees & Graphs  
- Dynamic Programming  
- Backtracking  
- Greedy Algorithms  
- Bit Manipulation  
- Math & Number Theory  

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure  
The problems are organized by their respective LeetCode problem numbers and titles for easy reference. Each solution file contains:  
- Problem statement (summary)  
- Approach/logic explanation (where necessary)  
- Optimized code solution  

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal  
The main purpose of this repository is to:  
- Keep track of my problem-solving journey  
- Build strong **DSA and algorithmic skills**  
- Share solutions that may help other learners  

## ðŸ’¡ Note  
- Solutions are written in **Java**.
